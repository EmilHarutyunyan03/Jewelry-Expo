Gold, for instance, has seen its value double over the past 10 years.<\/p><p>Accurate appraisals are important because if your jewelry is ever lost, stolen or damaged, your insurance company will refer to the appraisal document to settle the claim. An outdated appraisal will likely result in you being under-insured, and that could cost you thousands.Â <\/p><p>We recommend updating your appraisals every three to five years. Whether it's an engagement ring you wear every day or a piece you've just inherited from your grandmother's estate, we're ready to offer an appraisal for your security and peace of mind.<\/p>"
