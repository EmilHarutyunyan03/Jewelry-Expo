The fine silk can stretch and weaken, so if you see extra space between the knots that separate the pearls from each other, that could be a sign that the necklace needs to be restrung.<\/p><p>Trust our experts to handleÂ your finest pearl and gemstone beads.<\/p><p><em>We provide free estimates.<\/em><\/p>"
